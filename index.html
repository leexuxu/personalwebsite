		I am a Ph.D. candidate in Political Science at the Pennsylvania State University, with a major field in comparative politics (minors in methodology and political economy). I study authoritarianism and Chinese politics, with particular interests in <em>surveillance and repression</em>. My dissertation book project, <em>To Repress or To Co-opt? Authoritarian Control in the Age of Digital Surveillance</em>, explores how digital surveillance shapes the politics of violence and redistribution in authoritarian regimes, especially China. My work combines an attention to causal inference using experiments and archival data with game theory and field studies. My research has been published, or will soon appear, in journals including <em>The Journal of Politics</em> and <em>The Journal of Comparative Economics</em><em>.
