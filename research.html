<div class="content">
  <p>This paper studies the consequences of digital surveillance in dictatorships. I first
develop an informational theory of repression and co-optation. I argue that digital
surveillance resolves dictators’ information problem of not knowing individual citizens’ true anti-regime sentiments. By identifying radical opponents, digital surveillance enables dictators to substitute targeted repression for non-exclusive co-optation
to forestall coordinated uprisings. My theory implies that as digital surveillance technologies advance, we should observe a rise in targeted repression and a decline in universal redistribution. Using a difference-in-differences design that exploits temporal
variation in digital surveillance systems among Chinese counties, I find that surveillance increases local governments’ public security expenditure and arrests of political activists but decreases public goods provision. My theory and evidence suggest that
improvements in governments’ information make citizens worse off in dictatorships.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>This article uses new data measuring gradations of personalism in authoritarian regimes to
evaluate the relationship between concentration of power and patterns of repression. It shows
that the personalization of power in dictatorships leads to an increase in repression. Given the
rise in personalism we are witnessing globally, the findings of this study imply that repression
is likely to become more prevalent in dictatorships as a consequence.</p>

  <p>This paper presents evidence that autocratic culture adversely affects
social trust and political participation. We find that individuals whose ancestors
migrated from countries with higher autocracy levels are less likely to trust others
and to vote in presidential elections in the U.S. The impact of autocratic culture
on trust can last for at least three generations while the impact on voting
disappears after one generation. These impacts on trust and voting are also
significant across Europe. We further access the robustness of our findings
concerning selection into migration and other confounders such as home
countries’ economic conditions, human capital stocks, and the strength of family
ties.</p>

  <p>Chinese local leaders’ behaviors are driven by a career incentive structure in
which those delivering better performances are more likely to be promoted. Local leaders
signal competence when their superiors actively collect evidence to evaluate their
performances: these are years leading to the end of a five-year term. To create better
economic performances, local leaders lessen the enforcement of environmental regulations to
reduce local industries’ production costs and/or to attract firms from other jurisdictions. Such
selective enforcement creates an environmental political business cycle in which pollution
increases in years leading to the year of leader turnover. The empirical analysis on a panel of
Chinese prefectures of 2002-2010 reveals a U-shaped relationship between a prefecture’s
party secretary’s years in office and its average annual PM2.5 level.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Countries all around the world take serious measures to crack down on
corruption in the hope that reducing corruption would promote economic growth.
This paper investigates the negative consequences of anti-corruption measures
on economic outcomes. By exploring an unexpected corruption crackdown in
Northeast China in 2004, we are able to use a high-quality survey of large-scale
manufacturing firms that is available around early 2000s. We find that the crackdown
significantly lowers firm productivity and reduces firm entry in affected regions after
the event. The negative impacts on labor productivity and entry are mainly borne by
private and foreign firms instead of state-owned firms. We attribute these negative
impacts to the breaking up of firms’ political connections and the removal of the “grease
of the wheels” that helps firm perform in weak market institutions. We also find that the
corruption crackdown leads to an increase in the perceived corruption levels among
employees in both private and public sectors, which suggests that the crackdown may
have revealed corruption levels that are beyond the general expectation.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>Conventional wisdom holds that in non-democracies, a strong central state can reward and punish 
local administrations through a merit-based promotion system, which should restrain officials’ 
“grabbing hand”. But much evidence shows rampant corruption in countries with a powerful central 
government. This study argues that merit-based promotions can be compromised by three disincentives: 
factional politics at upper-level administrations, a lack of serious punishments for wrong-doing, 
and difficulties in evaluating officials’ performance, each of which is common in non-democracies. 
As a result, promotions could incentivize corruption. Using a fuzzy regression discontinuity design 
exploiting exogenous variations in officials’ promotion incentive from a mandatory age cutoff for 
promotion, combined with a biographical database of prefecture party secretaries and novel measures 
of corruption, I find that promotions encourage corruption in China. Moreover, prefecture party 
secretaries are more corrupt if their provincial superiors are connected to central factions, 
suggesting that upper-level factionalism is one of the disincentives that breaks down lower-level meritocracy.</p>

<div class="content">
  <p>This paper examines the social costs of digital surveillance versus in-person surveillance. I argue that both types of surveillance deter civic participation because citizens fear targeted repression. However, digital surveillance does not entail human-agent intrusion into private lives, and therefore is less likely to lower interpersonal trust and regime legitimacy. I find consistent evidence using a survey experiment with over 500 students in two universities in North and West China. The external validity of the experimental findings is established using the Chinese General Social Survey and an interrupted time-series design that exploits an exogenous shock to the intensity of digital surveillance and repression caused by the 2015 Tianjin Explosions in China.</p>
