<p>
In recent decades, the world’s autocracies are experiencing significant growth in domestic surveillance that utilizes technologies such as spyware, metadata collection, high-resolution cameras, facial recognition, and even artificial intelligence. China is a country that stands out from most of its autocratic peers in both scale and technological advancement of digital surveillance. My dissertation is the first to explore how digital surveillance shapes the politics of violence, redistribution, and civic participation in China, using causal inference methods with archival data and two in-the-field survey experiments conducted among 752 college students in three universities in North, East, and West China.</p>

<p>
In one chapter, I examine how digital surveillance empowers authoritarian governments to better control society by substituting targeted repression for non-exclusive co-optation to disrupt protest coordination. I use a difference-in-difference design based on the Chinese government’s phase-in digital surveillance programs. This chapter has been accepted by the <em>American Journal of Political Science</em>.</p>

<p>
In another chapter, I use a survey experiment to compare digital surveillance with traditional, informant-based surveillance, and find that although both types of surveillance deter expression and protest participation, digital surveillance is less likely to reduce interpersonal trust and regime legitimacy. The external validity of the findings is established using the Chinese General Social Survey and a regression discontinuity design that exploits an exogenous shock to the intensity of digital surveillance and repression caused by the 2015 Tianjin Explosions in China.</p>

<p>
The last chapter examines how government propaganda promotes public support of digital surveillance and how the revelation of its repressive potential reduces the support. I use a survey experiment to examine individuals’ opinion towards China’s new Social Credit System – a surveillance system that rewards and punishes citizens based on their “creditworthiness”. My dissertation establishes that digital surveillance is an ultimate tool of authoritarian control because it deters mobilization, reduces dictators’ social costs for total surveillance, and is largely supported by the public.</p>
